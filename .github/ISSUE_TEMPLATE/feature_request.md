## Description

Implement comprehensive code quality standards and automated formatting to ensure consistent code style across the project. This enhancement will improve maintainability, readability, and reduce technical debt.

## Current Issues

1. **Formatting Inconsistencies**

   - Missing proper blank lines between class/function definitions
   - Import sorting issues in multiple files
   - Inconsistent spacing in registry.py and server.py

2. **Code Quality Tools Integration**
   - Need proper configuration for:
     - Black (code formatting)
     - isort (import sorting)
     - Flake8 (linting)
     - SonarCloud (code quality)
     - Dependabot (dependency management)

## Proposed Changes

1. **Code Style Standardization**

   - [ ] Configure Black with project-specific settings
   - [ ] Set up isort with appropriate import grouping
   - [ ] Implement Flake8 with custom rules
   - [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for automated formatting

2. **CI/CD Integration**

   - [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflow to include code quality checks
   - [ ] Configure SonarCloud analysis
   - [ ] Set up Dependabot for automated dependency updates
   - [ ] Add automated PR checks for code quality

3. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Add code style guide to project documentation
   - [ ] Document development setup process
   - [ ] Create contribution guidelines
   - [ ] Add comments explaining complex code sections

## Implementation Plan

1. Create new feature branch: `feature/code-quality-standards`
2. Set up development environment:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/code-quality-standards
   ./scripts/init.sh
   ```
3. Implement changes in order:
   - Code formatting tools
   - CI/CD integration
   - Documentation updates
4. Create PR with:
   - Detailed description of changes
   - Updated test results
   - Documentation updates
   - CI/CD status
